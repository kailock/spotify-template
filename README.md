# spotify-template
This template is an optional starting point for a challenge for the following [course](http://faculty.washington.edu/mikefree/info343/) at the University of Washington.  The instructions are described [here](http://faculty.washington.edu/mikefree/info343/#/challenges/spotify).

What is the purpose of your project (i.e., why would someone use this app)?
For someone who wants to create a playlist and share it with friends! Although with the app's current state you
can only share the website, not the playlist itself..

What is the URL of this project on your student web-server?
http://students.washington.edu/kailock/info343/spotify-template/

Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc.)? If so, please list who.
Brandon Barron from Stern's class

Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?
10ish

Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?
I spent a lot of time trying to figure out scope issues! Also working with modals + angular is more challenging
than it seems. But altogether it was a less stressful assignment than others.
